# Project for Week 3

As a developer, I want to create a voting website that is completely functional, fills the client's needs, and is intuitive for the testers.

As a tester, I want to easily navigate the voting module so that I can easily give honest feedback to the marketing team.

As the marketing team, I want to effectively test the population for popular trends in product interest so that the client can decipher what items to produce for sale.  

As the client, I want to employ a developer, testers, and a marketing team so that I can discover which products out of the 20 concepts are most popular and will be most likely to generate profits.

As a student of Codefellows, I want to utilize all of the skills I've learned over the past two weeks to tackle a harder challenge and create a new website with a voting functionality.
